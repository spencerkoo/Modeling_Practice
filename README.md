# Modeling_Practice
This repo contains a few scripts that I used to practice some modeling and python work. The tsv files with the original data are far too large to upload to Github. In order to do the analysis, I ran my scripts using an AWS EC2 instance so I didn't run out of memory on my computer.

The goal of this exercise was to take raw data and predict if a customer would make a future purchase.
