The training data is pulled from raw logs. It has three columns that record user activity over time.
user_id: a hash that uniquely identifies the user.

activity_date: the date of the activity

activity_type: the type of activity



We would like to predict which users will purchase given the user's activities. 

Using the training data, build a model that predicts which user_id's will make a purchase in the future. Use the model to score the test data from most likely to least likely to purchase.



Please submit the following:

(1) Descibe which activity types you believe are most useful in predicting which user will purchase in the future.

(2) Provide a file containing the 1000 user_id's most likely to convert.

(3) [optional] Any work used to generate the list and/or notes you'd like to include.
